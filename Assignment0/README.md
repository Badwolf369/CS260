#### 5 Algorithms/Data Structures

#1. Boids:

3 set rules. 
- Separation: boids will try to avoid collision with objects and other boids; 
- Allignment: boids will try to allign to nearby boids; 
- Cohesion: boids will try to get to the center of the flock of boids.

These 3 simple rules create behavior incredibly similar to the movement of flocks of birds or schools of fish.

#2. Hashtables

This is the most likely method responsible for Dictionaries in python, which are my favorite data type excluding my own user defined ones.

#3. I dont actually know what the specific algorithms are called, but genetic AI learning algorithms are facinating to watch.

It is my goal to someday create a scenario in which I can apply a genetic learning algorithm

This video by SethBling goes over the details of how it works and how the neural network actually functions after the training: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44

#4. The algorithm where when you run out of memory for a string or array, you realloctae twice the amount of the current memory then move evrything over there.

Im yet to use this thing, not even sure it can be called an algorithm, but it seems incredibly useful.

I discovered it on this Stack Overflow post, top answer under "how to simulate arbitrary length string" https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20918341/arbitrary-length-string-in-c/20918363

#5. This is both an algorithm and a way for storing data: The Hilbert Curve

Using the hilbert curve you can map a 2 dimensional image onto a 1 dimensional line, useful for different things like say storing an arbitrary resolution image in ram(im sure theres a more efficient way of doing it but eh)

This specific usage of a hilburt curve to interpret images, albeit in a more practical setting, is shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc
